  <h1 class="post-title">Starting Your First Shrimp Tank</h1>

  Setting up your first shrimp tank can feel overwhelming, but with the right
  approach it’s simple and rewarding.

  ## Tank Size
  We recommend starting with at least 20–30 litres for stable water parameters.

  ## Substrate
  Active soil works best for Caridina shrimp, while inert substrates suit
  Neocaridina setups.

  ## Cycling
  Never rush cycling. A stable biofilter is more important than equipment.

  ## Final Thoughts
  Patience and consistency are the keys to shrimp success.
