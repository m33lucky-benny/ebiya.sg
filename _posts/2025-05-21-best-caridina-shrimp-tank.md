# The BEST Shrimp Tank Setup for Caridina Shrimp (Most People Get This Wrong)

If you’ve ever searched **“best shrimp tank setup for Caridina shrimp”**, chances are you’ve already lost shrimp… or you’re scared you will.

Here’s the truth most guides won’t tell you:

👉 **Caridina shrimp don’t die because they’re “sensitive.”**  
They die because the tank setup is wrong from day one.

After setting up and maintaining Caridina tanks in Singapore’s climate, I’ll break down **exactly what works**, what doesn’t, and how to avoid the mistakes that wipe out entire colonies.

---

## Why Most Caridina Shrimp Tank Setups Fail

Most beginners copy **Neocaridina setups** and hope for the best.

That’s mistake #1.

Caridina shrimp require:

- **Stable water chemistry**
- **Active buffering soil**  
  👉 [Recommended active soil](https://s.shopee.sg/20oXAyGM1g)
- **Controlled mineral levels**
- **Patience (not shortcuts)**

Miss even *one* of these, and you’ll see:

- Failed molts  
- Sudden deaths  
- No breeding  
- “Healthy today, dead tomorrow” syndrome  

---

## Best Tank Size for Caridina Shrimp (Bigger Is Safer)

### ✅ Recommended Tank Size
- **45–60 cm tank (≈30L) minimum**

**Why this works:**
- Larger water volume = more stable parameters
- Easier to control GH & TDS
- Slower swings = fewer deaths

❌ Nano tanks (<15L) are **not beginner-friendly**, no matter what social media says.

---

## The ONLY Substrate That Works Reliably for Caridina

### ✅ Active Buffering Soil (Non-Negotiable)

- **ADA Amazonia V1** *(if you can find it)*
- **Geilee Nature Soil**  
  👉 [View product](https://s.shopee.sg/8APAWISTor)

**Why active soil matters:**
- Buffers pH to **~5.5–6.2**
- Stabilizes acidic conditions Caridina need
- Supports long-term health and breeding

❌ Inert gravel + chemicals = unstable tank + dead shrimp.

---

## Water Setup — This Is Where Most People Kill Shrimp

### ❌ Tap Water (Even “Good” Tap Water)
- Inconsistent
- Unknown GH/KH swings
- Often causes molting failure

### ✅ Correct Water Setup
- **RO water**  
  👉 [RO water source](https://s.shopee.sg/7pmK99SBgS)
- **Shrimp-specific remineralizer**  
  👉 [Recommended remineralizer](https://s.shopee.sg/6KxWMQXmHH?share_channel_code=1)

### Target Parameters

| Parameter | Ideal Range |
|--------|------------|
| pH | 5.3 – 5.5 |
| GH | 4 – 6 |
| KH | 0 |
| TDS | 90 – 130 |

This single step alone improves survival rate **dramatically**.

---

## Filtration — Gentle, Not Powerful

### ✅ Best Filter for Caridina Shrimp
- Sponge filter
- Gentle airflow
- Shrimplet-safe intake

Strong flow stresses shrimp and affects feeding & breeding behavior.

**Simple > powerful.**

---

## Cycling the Tank (The Step Everyone Rushes)

Caridina shrimp tanks **must be fully cycled**.

### Minimum Cycling Time
- **6–8 weeks** (yes, really)

### Signs Your Tank Is Ready
- Stable TDS
- No ammonia or nitrite
- Biofilm forming on surfaces

Rushing this step is the fastest way to waste money on shrimp.

---

## Plants & Hardscape (Less Is More)

### Best Choices
- Mosses
- Cholla wood
- Leaf litter (Indian almond leaves)

### Benefits
- Natural grazing
- Stress reduction
- Better survival for shrimplets

Avoid complicated aquascapes that trap waste early on.

---

## Common Beginner Mistakes (Learn From Others, Not Your Wallet)

❌ Changing water parameters too fast  
❌ Overfeeding  
❌ Chasing numbers daily  
❌ Mixing Caridina with Neocaridina  
❌ Copying YouTube setups blindly  

Caridina shrimp reward **stability**, not micromanagement.
