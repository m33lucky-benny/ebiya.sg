# Shrimp Tank Water Parameters Explained (Caridina-Friendly Guide for Beginners in Singapore)

If you’re keeping shrimp in Singapore, water parameters matter more than anything else.  
This is especially true for **Caridina shrimp**, which are sensitive to pH, mineral levels, and temperature.

This beginner-friendly guide explains **exact water parameters**, why **RO water is recommended**, how Singapore tap water affects shrimp tanks, and—most importantly—**how much time it really takes to care for a shrimp tank**.

---

## Why Water Parameters Matter for Shrimp Tanks

Shrimp don’t tolerate sudden changes well. Unlike fish, they live directly in contact with the substrate and water, making them extremely sensitive to:

- pH swings  
- Mineral imbalance (GH & TDS)  
- Temperature stress  
- Inconsistent water changes  

Most shrimp tank failures happen not because shrimp are “hard,” but because **parameters are unstable or unsuitable for the species**.

---

## Recommended Water Parameters for Caridina Shrimp

These parameters are **beginner-safe**, **Singapore-tested**, and suitable for long-term Caridina health.

### Ideal Caridina Shrimp Water Parameters

- **pH:** 5.3 – 5.5  
- **GH:** 4 – 6  
- **KH:** 0 – 1  
- **TDS:** 100 – 120 ppm  
- **Temperature:** 23 – 25°C (ideal range)

Keeping parameters within this range promotes:
- Proper molting  
- Strong survival rates  
- Stable breeding conditions  

---

## Singapore Tap Water vs RO Water for Shrimp Tanks

### Why Singapore Tap Water Is Risky for Caridina

Singapore tap water is safe for humans, but for Caridina shrimp it often has:
- Higher and inconsistent TDS  
- Unstable mineral composition  
- pH unsuitable for acidic setups  

Even when treated, tap water can vary from day to day.

---

## Why RO Water Is Strongly Recommended

Using **RO (Reverse Osmosis) water** gives you **full control** over shrimp tank water parameters.

Benefits of RO water:
- Consistent pH and mineral levels  
- Easier parameter matching during water changes  
- Fewer unexplained shrimp deaths  

### RO Equipment I Recommend
👉 RO system:  
- 👉 [**RO water system**](https://s.shopee.sg/7pmK99SBgS)

### Water Conditioner I Personally Use
👉 RO water conditioner:  
- 👉[**Shrimp-specific remineralizer**](https://s.shopee.sg/6KxWMQXmHH?share_channel_code=1)


With RO water, you **add only what shrimp need**, nothing extra.

---

## Best Soil for Caridina Shrimp Tanks

Soil choice directly affects pH stability.

I only recommend:
- **ADA Aqua Soil (Version 1)**
- **Geilee Active Soil**

- 👉 [**Geilee 8L**](https://s.shopee.sg/8APAWISTor)

Wrong soil choice is one of the **most common beginner mistakes** and leads to:
- Rising pH  
- Parameter drift  
- Shrimp losses over time  

---

## How Much Time Does It Really Take to Care for a Shrimp Tank?

This is something many beginners worry about—but the reality is simpler than expected.

### Daily Care Time
- **Less than 1 minute**
- Just a quick observation:
  - Shrimp activity
  - Molting
  - Any unusual behaviour

---

### Weekly Maintenance
- **About 10 minutes**
- Includes:
  - Small water change
  - Parameter check (optional once tank is stable)

Consistency matters more than doing “too much.”

---

### Monthly Tasks
- Light filter check (if needed)
- General observation
- No heavy cleaning if tank is healthy

---

### The Real Secret: Patience

Shrimp tanks don’t reward constant interference.  
**Patience and time** are often more important than tools, additives, or gadgets.

Many beginners lose shrimp by:
- Changing too much, too often  
- Chasing numbers aggressively  
- Rushing setups before the tank stabilises  

---

## Common Beginner Mistakes with Caridina Shrimp

- Using the wrong soil  
- Ignoring temperature control  
- Over-maintaining the tank  
- Relying on tap water inconsistently  
- Expecting instant results  

A stable shrimp tank is built slowly—and maintained gently.

---

## Should You Follow a Guided Setup?

If you want:
- Proven Singapore-specific parameters  
- Clear setup steps  
- Guidance before problems appear  

You may find it easier to follow a structured approach.

## Final Thoughts

Keeping Caridina shrimp in Singapore is absolutely achievable—even for beginners—when water parameters are controlled properly.

Focus on:
- Correct pH, GH, and TDS  
- RO water over tap water  
- Stable temperature  
- Patience over perfection  

Get these right, and shrimp keeping becomes **calm, predictable, and rewarding**.
