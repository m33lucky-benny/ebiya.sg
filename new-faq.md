        <p>Caridina shrimp are freshwater dwarf shrimp known for their stunning colors and patterns, including popular varieties like Crystal Red Shrimp (CRS), Crystal Black Shrimp (CBS), and Taiwan Bee shrimp. They are highly sought after for their beauty, active behavior, and fascinating breeding potential.</p>
        <p>These shrimp spend their days grazing on biofilm, exploring plants, and displaying colors from deep reds and blacks to striking blues and golds. Their peaceful nature and small size make them perfect for nano aquariums and planted tanks.</p>

        <h3>Can Caridina shrimp survive in Singapore without a chiller?</h3>
        <span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer" id="answer-2" role="region">
        <p>It is challenging but possible with the right approach. Caridina shrimp prefer 20–24°C, while Singapore rooms often sit at 28–32°C. Long term, serious keeping usually requires either a chiller or a consistently air-conditioned room.</p>
        <p>Fans and smart tank placement can shave off a few degrees, but they are often not enough during hotter periods. For stable breeding colonies, plan for active cooling rather than relying only on ambient room temperature.</p>

        <h3>What makes a good shrimp tank?</h3>
        <span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer" id="answer-11" role="region">
        <p>A good shrimp tank prioritizes water stability, grazing surface area, and safety for shrimplets. Wider tanks offer more usable floor space than tall, narrow tanks.</p>
        <p>Use gentle filtration, plenty of plants and moss, and an active buffering substrate if you are keeping caridina. Stable parameters matter more than fancy equipment.</p>
