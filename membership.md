# 🦐 ebiyaSG Membership  
## Build Your Caridina Shrimp Tank Right — The First Time

Stop guessing. Stop losing shrimp.  
The **ebiyaSG Membership** gives you a proven system to build and maintain **stable, healthy Caridina shrimp tanks**, designed specifically for **Singapore conditions**.

Whether you’re starting fresh or fixing an unstable tank, this membership removes uncertainty and costly mistakes.

---

## Why Most Shrimp Keep Dying

If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone:

- Shrimp die “randomly”
- Failed molts despite good test results
- Conflicting advice from forums and YouTube
- Rebuying shrimp again and again
- Fear of touching the tank

The issue isn’t effort — it’s **lack of clear, consistent guidance**.

---

## What the ebiyaSG Membership Solves

Members gain clarity on:
- Tank setup that actually works
- Stable water parameters
- Soil and water aging
- Breeding readiness
- Problem prevention before losses occur

This is not theory.
