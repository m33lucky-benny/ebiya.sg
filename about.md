# About ebiya.SG

ebiyaSG is a Singapore-based Caridina shrimp specialist and custom tank builder dedicated to helping shrimp keepers succeed where others struggle.

## From Hobby to Expertise

What started as a personal passion in 2018 has evolved into a professional breeding operation built on years of hands-on experience. As a solo-run business partnered with a skilled tank-building team, ebiyaSG combines the precision of specialist breeding with the practical knowledge gained from countless trial-and-error cycles. Located conveniently near Old Airport Road Food Centre, the operation focuses on what truly matters: keeping shrimp alive and breeding consistently.

## What We Offer

### Premium Caridina Shrimp

ebiyaSG specializes in high-grade Caridina varieties bred for health and stability:

- **BOA** - Bold, distinctive patterns
- **GALAXY** - Striking celestial markings  
- **BLUE KING KONG** - Vibrant blue coloration

All shrimp are bred in-house using the same tank systems available to customers, ensuring proven performance under Singapore conditions.

### Custom Breeding Tanks

Two meticulously designed tank sizes engineered specifically to maximize shrimplet survival rates:

- **60×30cm** - Recommended for beginners due to higher water stability
- **45×30cm** - Compact option for experienced keepers

These aren't aesthetic showpieces—they're functional breeding systems designed from a breeder's perspective. For detailed explanations of the design philosophy and engineering principles, customers are encouraged to explore the comprehensive guides available on the [blog](/blog/).

## How We Serve You

**In-Store Pickup** is the preferred collection method, allowing for personal consultation and quality assurance. **VIP Gold members** enjoy delivery privileges as part of their membership benefits. **Shipping** options are available upon inquiry for those outside the immediate area.

## Why ebiyaSG Exists

Every shrimp keeper has experienced the frustration of unexplained deaths, failed molts despite "perfect" parameters, and conflicting advice from forums. ebiyaSG was built by someone who lived through those exact struggles and emerged with solutions that actually work.

The mission is simple: help new shrimp keepers avoid the expensive mistakes and discouragement that drive so many out of the hobby. Every tank design, product recommendation, and piece of guidance stems from real breeding experience—not theory or aesthetics. The focus is unwavering: **functionality that keeps shrimplets alive and colonies thriving**.

Caridina shrimp aren't fragile—they require precision, patience, and the right system. ebiyaSG provides exactly that.
